=== 2.0.0 / Unreleased

BREAKING CHANGES:

  * The minimum required Ruby version has been raised to 2.7.0

Other changes:

  * Added `Ascii85.decode_raw`. The new method does not expect the input to be 
    wrapped in `<~` and `~>` delimiters.
  * Added `Ascii85.extract`. The new method extracts encoded text from between
    `<~` and `~>` so that it can be fed to `#decode_raw`.
  * Added option to pass an IO-object as input to `#encode` and `#decode_raw`
    instead of a String.
  * Added option to also pass an IO-object to `#encode` and `#decode_raw` for
    output. Output is written to the object instead of being returned as a String.
  * If both input and output to `#encode` or `#decode_raw` are IO objects,
    Ascii85 can now work in a streaming fashion, using constant memory instead
    of storing the entire input/intermediate results/output in memory.
