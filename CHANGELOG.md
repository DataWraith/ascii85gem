### Added

- `Ascii85.decode_raw` method that doesn't expect the input to be wrapped in `<~` and `~>` delimiters.
- `Ascii85.extract` method to extract encoded text from between `<~` and `~>` for feeding to `#decode_raw`.
- Option to pass an IO-object as input to `#encode` and `#decode_raw` instead of a String.
- Option to pass an IO-object to `#encode` and `#decode_raw` for output. Output is written to the object instead of being returned as a String.
