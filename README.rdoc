= Ascii85

* http://ascii85.rubyforge.org


== DESCRIPTION:

Ascii85 is a simple gem that provides methods for encoding/decoding Adobe's
binary-to-text encoding of the same name.

See http://www.adobe.com/products/postscript/pdfs/PLRM.pdf page 131 and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii85 for more information about the format.


== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'ascii85'

  Ascii85.encode("Ruby")
  => "<~;KZGo~>"

  Ascii85.decode("<~;KZGo~>")
  => "Ruby"

In addition, Ascii85.encode can take a second parameter that specifies the
length of the returned lines. The default is 80; use +false+ for unlimited.

Ascii85.decode expects the input to be enclosed in <~ and ~> — it
ignores everything outside of these. The output of Ascii85.decode
will have the ASCII-8BIT encoding, so in Ruby 1.9 you may have to use
<tt>String#force_encoding</tt> to correct the encoding.


== Command-line utility

This gem includes +ascii85+, a command-line utility modeled after +base64+ from
the GNU coreutils. It can be used to encode/decode Ascii85 directly from the
command-line:

    Usage: ascii85 [OPTIONS] [FILE]
    Encodes or decodes FILE or STDIN using Ascii85 and writes to STDOUT.
        -w, --wrap COLUMN                Wrap lines at COLUMN. Default is 80, use 0 for no wrapping
        -d, --decode                     Decode the input
        -h, --help                       Display this help and exit
            --version                    Output version information


== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install Ascii85
